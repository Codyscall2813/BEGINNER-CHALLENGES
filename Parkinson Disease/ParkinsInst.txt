Project: Parkinson Disease Prediction
using Machine Learning
• Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a person
has Parkinson’s disease based on health metrics and voice features.
• Dataset: Parkinson’s Disease Dataset
Project Goals:
1. Importing Libraries and Dataset:
• Load required Python libraries:
o Pandas for handling datasets.
o NumPy for numerical operations.
o Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
o Sklearn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
o XGBoost for high-performance machine learning classification.
o Imblearn to handle imbalanced data.
• Load the dataset using Pandas and explore its structure.
2. Data Preprocessing:
• Handle missing values if any.
• Normalize/scale numerical features for better model performance.
• Encode categorical variables if required.
• Check for class imbalance and apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) if necessary.
• Split dataset into training and testing sets (80%-20%).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Visualize feature distributions using histograms and boxplots.
• Use correlation heatmaps to identify the most important features for
prediction.
• Identify trends in voice features that contribute to Parkinson’s disease.
4. Model Training and Selection:
• Train different machine learning models:
o Logistic Regression
o Random Forest
o Support Vector Machine (SVM)
o XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
• Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-
score.
5. Model Evaluation and Prediction:
• Evaluate the best model based on classification metrics.
• Test the model with new patient data to predict Parkinson’s disease.
• Use ROC-AUC curves to assess model performance.
Conclusion:
• This model helps in early Parkinson’s disease detection using voice and
movement-related data.
• Future improvements can involve Deep Learning models for better accuracy.
