## ✨ Key Features

- **Data Loading & Exploration:** Load and inspect the Parkinson’s dataset.  
- **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, scale features, and encode labels.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize distributions and correlations of vocal features.  
- **Model Training & Selection:** Compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optional GridSearchCV for best model parameters.  
- **Final Evaluation:** Report accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix.  
- **Prediction Summary:** View sample predictions with probabilities.  
- **Interpretability:** Identify the most predictive voice features (e.g., PPE, DFA, RPDE).
