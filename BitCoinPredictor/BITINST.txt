Project: Bitcoin Price Prediction using
Machine Learning
• Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict Bitcoin price trends
based on historical data, helping traders make informed investment
decisions.
• Dataset: Bitcoin Historical Price Dataset
Project Goals:
1. Importing Necessary Libraries and Dataset:
• Load required Python libraries:
o Pandas for handling datasets.
o NumPy for numerical operations.
o Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
o Sklearn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
o XGBoost for high-performance machine learning prediction.
• Load the dataset using Pandas and check its structure.
2. Data Preprocessing:
• Handle missing values by filling them with previous data points.
• Convert date columns into DateTime format and set as index.
• Normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler for uniform scaling.
• Create new features like Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Bollinger Bands, and
RSI.
• Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Visualize Bitcoin price trends over time using line charts.
• Analyze the impact of volume, volatility, and historical patterns on price
changes.
• Identify correlations between different technical indicators.
4. Model Training and Selection:
• Train different machine learning models:
o Linear Regression
o Random Forest
o Support Vector Machine (SVM)
o XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
o LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for deep learning
• Compare model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
5. Model Evaluation and Prediction:
• Evaluate the best model based on:
o Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
o Mean Squared Error (MSE)
o R² Score
• Predict Bitcoin price trends using real-time data from APIs (e.g., Binance,
CoinGecko).
Conclusion:
• This model helps traders predict Bitcoin price trends based on past
patterns.
• Future improvements can include deep learning models like LSTMs or
Transformers for better accuracy.
