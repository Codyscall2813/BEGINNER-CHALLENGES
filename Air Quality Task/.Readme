## Project Overview

This project implements both Facebook Prophet and LSTM models to forecast air quality (PM2.5) levels based on historical data. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, visualization, and deployment-ready exports.

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Pip package manager

**Required Libraries:**

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn prophet tensorflow
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   ```

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-prediction.git](https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-prediction.git)
cd air-quality-prediction

````
2. Install dependencies (see Prerequisites).
3. Ensure your dataset file is named `air_pollution_data.csv` and placed in the project root.

---

## Usage
Run the analysis script:
```bash
python air_quality_analysis.py
````

Results, visualizations, and exported files will be generated in the `outputs/` directory.
