Project Title:
Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

Technologies:
Python, Google Colab

Difficulty Level:
Medium

Project Description:
This project focuses on predicting air quality using machine learning techniques. You will build a
model to analyze and forecast air pollution levels based on historical data. This hands-on
experience will help you understand how to preprocess time-series data, build predictive
models, and evaluate their performance.

Project Requirements:
Tools and Environment
• Platform: Use Google Colab to run your code. It is pre-installed with necessary libraries
and simplifies collaboration and sharing.
• Dataset: Download the Air Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Libraries Required:
1. Data Manipulation and Analysis:
o pandas
o numpy
2. Data Visualization:
o matplotlib
o seaborn

3. Machine Learning:
o scikit-learn
4. Forecasting:
o fbprophet

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Set Up Your Workspace
• Open Google Colab.
• Create a new notebook and name it Air Quality Prediction.
• Upload the dataset to Colab.
2. Data Understanding
• Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
• Explore the data:
o View the first few rows using .head().
o Check for missing values using .isnull().sum().
o Display data types and statistics using .info() and .describe().

3. Data Preprocessing
• Handle missing values:
o Replace invalid or missing values (-200) with NaN.
o Use the column mean to fill missing values.
• Convert Date and Time columns into a single datetime column. Ensure it follows the
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.
4. Feature Engineering
• Retain important columns, such as pollutant levels and weather conditions.
• Scale the data using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
5. Model Development
• Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
• Build a time-series forecasting model using fbprophet:
o Rename the datetime column to ds and the target column to y.
o Train the model on ds and y.
o Predict future air quality levels.

6. Model Evaluation
• Use evaluation metrics such as:
o Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
o Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
o R-squared (R2)
• Visualize actual vs. predicted pollutant levels using matplotlib.

Extra Challenges (Optional):
1. Predict air quality for a specific future period (e.g., one week ahead).
2. Create a dashboard for interactive visualization.
3. Use additional models like LSTM for comparison.
