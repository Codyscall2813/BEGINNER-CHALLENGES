Project: Heart Disease Prediction using
Logistic Regression
• Objective: Develop a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to
predict the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in patients based
on health metrics.
• Dataset: Framingham Heart Disease Dataset

Project Goals:
1. Importing Necessary Libraries and Dataset:
• Load required Python libraries:
o Pandas for handling datasets.
o NumPy for numerical operations.
o Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
o Sklearn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
• Load the dataset using Pandas and check its structure.
• Drop unnecessary columns (education).
• Rename columns for better readability.
2. Data Preprocessing:
• Handle missing values by removing rows with NaN values.
• Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler for uniform scaling.
• Convert categorical variables into numerical form if needed.
• Split dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Analyze class distribution of heart disease cases (CHD = 0 or 1).
• Visualize data distributions using histograms, count plots, and correlation
heatmaps.
• Identify key risk factors such as age, cholesterol, smoking, blood pressure,
and glucose levels.
4. Model Training using Logistic Regression:
• Define the Logistic Regression Model.

• Train the model on the training dataset.
• Use Binary Cross-Entropy Loss as the loss function.
5. Model Evaluation and Prediction:
• Evaluate model performance using:
o Accuracy Score
o Precision, Recall, F1-Score
o Confusion Matrix
o ROC-AUC Curve
• Predict the likelihood of heart disease in new patient data.

Conclusion:
• This model helps in early heart disease detection using key health
indicators.
• Future improvements can include Ensemble Learning (Random Forest,
XGBoost) for better accuracy.
